## Boba

### 7 leaves
Get the mung bean.

### Happy Lemon
Can get this in the bay, but it's still worth getting anywhere. Get the Matcha Latte with Tiramisu Salted Cheese; it's
my personal favorite. 

### Tea Brick
I saw [Tommy Trinh](https://www.instagram.com/cinematommy/?hl=en) here last time I went (one of my creative 
inspirations)! Don't remember if the boba quality was good or not. 

## Foods
### Tacos el Gordo (San Diego)
Waited over 1 hour for some tacos, worth.

### Ave 26 Taco Stand
Pretty unique location. It's a big tent along side a railroad. No seating or anything, it's literally on a street.
Really cheap $1 tacos. Fast serving. Be sure to get a potato at the end. Oh, and don't forget the sides. Caramelized 
onions on the left. 

### Burgerim
Decent tiny burgers. Can also get this in the bay. 

### The Crack Shack
Boujee Chick-fil-a. 

### Facing East Noodle and Bar
Pretty yummy baos.

### Shin-Sen-Gumi Yakitori & Shabu-Shabu - Monteray Park
My god. All you can eat hot pot good-ness. Definitely one of the places I've been wanted to come back to. There's
also all you can eat yakitori (the little meat sticks). 

## Desserts
### MNGO
Solid mango desserts. Would highly recommend.
