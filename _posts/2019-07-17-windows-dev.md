Considering the fact that im coming from using macOS for pretty much entire life, it was really important for me to
mimic a mac-like developer environment while stilling using Windows 10, of course. 

I pretty much followed [this guide](https://char.gd/blog/2017/how-to-set-up-the-perfect-modern-dev-environment-on-windows)
and highly recommend you do too if you're looking to get yourself a proper developer environment. 

Here are my thoughts and experiences with some of the tools.

- Visual bugs are pretty common. I produced the below image by typing `ls -l` followed by `clear`, which should clear 
the entire terminal. Unfortunately, that is not the case. I can get rid of this my simply clicking inside the terminal
(but who wants to do that?).
