While this guide is being written, please enjoy a select few of [my favorite photos](https://twitter.com/BubblyBryan/status/1172358980577853440) from Japan!
If you don't want to read everything, I'll make a **tl;dr** at the bottom.

# Before The Trip

### Decide on the major cities you want to go to

For my trip, I went to Osaka for 3 nights in an Airbnb, Kyoto for 2 nights 
in a hotel, Tokyo for 3 nights in a hotel, and Nara for 1 night in a super fancy hotel. That's pretty much 8 full days in Japan, surrounded by 2
travel days.

If I had enough time, I would definitely spend more days in each city. This, of course, depends on what you like to do.
I really loved Kyoto and all of the nature-sightseeing it had to offer. Tokyo and Osaka are very urban. People are super
busy here and pay no attention to travelers like us. Nara would be the only exception in my opinion. It seemed to be quite small
compared to all the other places I went to, but 2 nights there would have been nice. 

> **[Here's a map](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qYCU4fRZ74ZdszENeX4Vh2xmz0mlJC8i)** I used to help me decide on 
which places to go based on location. It's pretty messy and incomplete, so I wouldn't use it for anything more than 
inspiration. 

### Make any reservations you may need

If you want a spot at some of the hottest restaurants or attractions, you might have to make reservations, so be sure to 
do your research. One example is the [famous Omurice place](http://dongree.xsrv.jp/kichikichi/reserve/notes-on-reservation/).
The reservation system refreshes every Sunday, and getting a spot here is as hard as getting a tickets to a really popular
concert. I, unfortunately, was not able to secure a spot for my trip :(

### Pre-trip expenses

| Item | Price | Notes |
|:--------|:-------:|--------:|
| Air Fare | 1,767.99 USD | 3 Person Round Trip<br> SFO *(Sep 2, 2019)* &#8594; LAX &#8594; KIX <br> ITM *(Sep 12, 2019)* &#8594; HND &#8594; SFO<br> Booked + Payed for on 11 Apr 2019|
| Osaka AirBnb | 180.05 USD | Sep 3 &#8594; Sep 6 <br> 3 nights, 3 people |
| Kyoto Tower Hotel Annex | 334.95 USD | Sep 6 &#8594; Sep 8 <br> 2 nights, 3 people |
| Tokyo Airbnb | 313.28 USD | Sep 8 &#8594; Sep 11 <br> 3 nights, 3 people |
| Nara Hotel (Kasuga Hotel) | 503.66 USD | Sep 11 &#8594; Sep 12 <br> 1 night, 3 people <br> Dinner + Breakfast provided |
| [JR 7 Day Pass](https://www.iace-usa.com/index.php/en/jrpass/ticketssale) | 795.00 USD | 7 days, 3 people |
|=====
|Total |3,894.93 USD | Again, this would be for 3 people<br> **1 Person ~ 1,293.31 USD** |

### Should I Buy a JR Pass?

This largely depends on where you want to go. Probably the biggest saving point for this is if you're planning to travel
to and from Tokyo from another location. For example, a 1-way ticket from Osaka to Tokyo will cost about 137.65 USD 
according to [this post](https://tokyocheapo.com/travel/transport/tokyo-to-osaka-fast-cheap/). Round trip would then 
cost 275.30 USD. If you have a 7-day JR pass, you could do this round-trip for whatever the cost of the JR pass. In my
case 245 USD for 1 person. 

> Round trip Osaka &#8594; Tokyo, no JR pass: 275.30 USD

> Round trip Osaka &#8594; Tokyo, JR pass: 245 USD

> Buying JR Pass already saves you ~ 30 USD

Not to mention, doing that round trip without a JR pass means that's all you get. JR passes let you ride 
**some of the city's** railways for free. So you're saving even more money. 
There's sites [like these](https://www.japan-guide.com/railpass/) that help you do such calculations, but
I never got around to really trusting them.
