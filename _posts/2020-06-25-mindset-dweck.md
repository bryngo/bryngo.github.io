It's been a second since I've picked up a book. Maybe several seconds. _Minutes?_ **Hours?** _**Days?**_
Probably a good number of years to be honest. It's surprising how far you can
get by in college without ever opening a non-technical book.

Anyways, this book is going to be my first in a while. Have you read it? Would
love to hear your thoughts on it as I document my own thoughts here :)

Book Club notes on Mindset by Carol S. Dweck, Ph.D.

# Chapter 1 - The Mindsets
Here's an excerpt form the end of the chapter that really stuck out to me.

> Okay, now image you've decided to learn a new language and you've signed up for
> a class. A few sessions into the course, the instructor calls you to the front of
> the room and starts throwing questions at you one after another.
>
> Put yourself in a fixed mindset. Your ability is on the line. Can you feel everyone's
> eyes on you? Can you see the instructor's face evaluating you? Feel the tension,
> feel your ego bristle and waver. What else are you thinking and feeling?
>
> Now put yourself in a growth mindset. You're a novice - that's why you're here.
> You're here to learn. The teacher is a resource for learning. Feel the tension
> leave you; feel your mind open up.
>
> pg. 14

I felt this passage because I could imagine it so vividly. There were many times in
my life where I was put on the line in a similar way, but let the stress and anxiety
get to me. I let it effect my actions that followed immediately in a negative way.
A fool would be made of myself, and I would learn nothing from the situation; my
confidence would be shot. **The fixed mindset.**

But that's not all. I also felt the growth mindset. There are also many times where,
put in a similar situation, I didn't care that I didn't know the answer to a question while
being in the spotlight. That's fine. I think it's unrealistic to imagine and expect yourself
to be this perfect human being who's supposed to know it all. In such situations under
a growth mindset, I find myself owning up to my lack of knowledge. I identify it, and
communicate the lack of in order to obtain knowledge from others in a fearless way.

I'm happy to say that my transition from a fixed mindset to a more growth mindset
has happened pretty organically over the course of my life. Needless to say, I
definitely don't have a 100% growth mindset yet, but it's something I'm fearlessly
striving for.
